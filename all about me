        <h2>What I am doing now <span> </h2>
     <p>I am currently working at the Ottawa Public Health Laboratory.  I have been there for 23 years. I started 
     there maintaining the computer systems, and transitioned into a Laboratory Attendant.  We do alot of "preventable
     Disease" testing, and most recently, COVID testing.
     I have always been intrigued by coding.  I did a little bit in College.

     <h2> About Me </h2>
     
     <p> I am a mother of an amazing 16 year old.  I have also been married for the past 18 years.
     Since COVID started, I realized that I needed to make a change.  I was going to just take a couple of courses,
     to get my brain stimulated, but then one of my friend sent me he link to this coding course.
